      "contents": "\nIntroduction\n“Correlation does not imply causation.” You might have heard this saying from your intro statistics course, and we knew if we’d like to find some evidence that makes us believe the causation. In causal inference, we will investigate the causal relationship between treatment (policy/ dosage/ drug/ habits, etc.) and the outcome of interest. By assigning people to different groups, we try to use various methods to reach the causal conclusion on which group has a better outcome? To do this, we should estimate the “causal effect”.\nA common way of estimating this is to calculate the average causal effect (ACE), denoted by:\n\\(E[Y^{a=1}]- E[Y^{a=0}]\\).\nIn this formula, a represents the potential treatment assignment: \\(a=0\\) means the individual will not be assigned treatment (control), and \\(a=1\\) dictates receiving treatment. In causal inference study, a huge blind spot is that after we observe the data, we want to know what would happen to an individual if they were to be assigned into the other group; unfortunately, this can never happen. As a result, we use capital \\(A\\) to represent the actual treatment received, and \\(a\\) for potential treatment under causal inference studies. \\(Y\\) is the outcome - it can be either quantitative or indicative. Combining together, the formula above makes sense: it records the average difference in the potential outcome between treatment and control group.\nIn statistics, after defining some particular interests and writing them out as mathematical formulas, researchers look for estimators to estimate the true parameter (in our case, that is the ACE). Doubly Robust Estimator (DRE) is a nice one due to its unbiasedness, meaning its average is equivalent to the true value of parameter (ACE). The reason it is called “doubly” is from the fact that DRE is composed of two different estimators: Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW), and Outcome Regression Model (REG). While this may not make any sense, don’t worry - in the next section, “Regression and IPW”, we will firstly go through these two regular, popular approaches in estimating ACE, and see how our doubly robust estimator serves to combine them and become even more powerful!\nMotivation of the project\nEstimating causal effects from data is a fundamental problem in many fields, including health care, economics, and many (social) sciences subjects. Xiang comes from an economic background whereas Kristy comes from a biology background. We teamed up and decided to explore this new, popular method, Doubly Robust estimation (DRE), which is widely used in biostatistics and econometric applications in many Difference-in-Difference (DiD, another way to say we are examining causal effects) experiments and causal inference contexts.\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "Outcome Regression and Inverse Probability Weighting",
      "author": [],
      "contents": "\nPre DRE: Two common adjusting methods\nPreviously, we talked about two commonly used approaches for estimating ACE: outcome regression estimator (REG) and Inverse-Probability Weighting (IPW). When using outcome regression and IPW to estimate a causal effect, both methods are unbiased only if the statistical model is correctly specified- this requires our knowledge of predictors and guessing their associations with outcome correctly (which can be really difficult and impractical!). Let’s take a look at how they work.\nOutcome regression (REG)\nThe central idea about Outcome Regression Estimator (REG) is to cut off all non-causal paths between treatment variable A to outcome variable Y by applying the idea of Markov Assumption and D-separation in the causal graph (also known as directed acyclic graph, DAG).\nOutcome regression estimator is a statistical method used to estimate the relationship between treatment variables (A) and the outcome variable (Y). The outcome regression estimator can be used to make predictions about the outcome variable based on the values of the treatment variables, and it can also be used to test hypotheses about the relationship between the treatment variables and the outcome variable.\nThrough the Causal Markov Assumption the D-separation, the distributions of A and Y conditional on confounder set Z are conditionally independent. In this way, we successfully block association flow along non-causal paths because we have controlled the study units to share same values of Z before we compare them. This also means we have achieved conditionally exchangeability of the outcomes Y across treatment groups A. Therefore, now we are able to inspect within the subset of the data defined by Z and compare the average outcome (probability of Y) between the treatment groups A.\nThe mathematical formula expressing the REG model is: where we fit a linear regression on A and Z, \\(\\beta_1\\) will then become our estimation on average causal effect (ACE): it represents the change in the expected value of outcome Y when we compare a treatment unit to a control unit, assuming they share the same Z value.\n\\[\nE[Y|A,Z]=\\beta_0+\\beta_1A+\\beta_2Z\\\\\n\\hat \\beta_1=E[Y|A=1,Z]-E[Y|A=0,Z]=E[Y^{a=1}|Z]-E[Y^{a=0}|Z]\n\\]\nBy calculating Yi for each observation in every treatment condition, \\(A=1\\) and \\(A=0\\), we get the sample mean of outcome \\(E[Y^{A=a}]\\):\n\\[\nE[Y^{A=a}]=\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\hat Y_i\n\\]\nWhen Z is both correctly identified and modeled, this is an unbiased estimate of the mean potential outcome had the entire population received treatment for all people (so both treatment and control groups).\nInverse Probability Weighting (IPW)\nThe central idea about IPW is to cut off the relationship between potential confounders Z to treatment variable A by reconstructing “pseudo population” from the data we have.\nInverse probability weighting (IPW) relies on the idea of building a logistic regression model that can be used to estimate the probability of being a treatment/ control unit observed for a particular observation (assuming that the confounders have been controlled). This predicted probability (after being converted from the output of the logistic regression model) is called propensity score in subsequent analyses. IPW is unique in measuring average causal effect by removing confounding variables using these weights.\nThis method is used under non-randomized trials (where the randomized trials are seen as the “gold standard” in causal studies): the number of people receiving treatment and control are not equal. As groups are imbalanced, we want to create a “pseudo-population” where half are treated and half are not treated.\nThis is achieved by re-weighting outcomes so that they reflect the global distribution of population sizes and help us to remove non-causal paths, thus leading to unbiased comparison. The weight for a particular Z group is the inverse of the propensity score, the probability of being assigned to the treatment/ control group, given patients attributes (Z).\n\\[\nWeight_{a=1}=\\frac{1}{P(A=1|Z)}=\\frac{1}{\\widehat {PS_i}}\nWeight_{a=0}=\\frac{1}{P(A=0|Z)}=\\frac{1}{1-\\widehat {PS_i}}\n\\]\nThis intuition can be reflected in the formula, where we adjust the formula by multiplying the propensity score, we end up getting the inverse probability weighting (IPW) formula:\n\\[\nP(Y|A=a)=\\sum_{i=1}^n P(Y|A=a, Z)P(Z)\\\\\nE[Y^{a=1}]=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n(\\frac {E[Y_i|A=1]}{\\widehat{PS_i}})\\\\\nE[Y^{a=0}]=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n(\\frac {E[Y_i|A=0]}{1-\\widehat{PS_i}})\\\\\nACE=E[Y^{a=1}]-E[Y^{a=0}]\n\\]\n\n\n\n",

We used the biased ipw results from the ‘nested_df’ dataset.\n\n\n\nThe plot shows a obvious trend that all data points from biased IPW model shift upward, which the ACE for incorrect IPW model is higher than the ACE=10 we set in the beginning.\n\n\n\nWe overestimated the true ACE (which is 10) if we wrongly specified the model form in IPW setting.\nStrategy 2: REG estimator (model the outcome)\nThe same (correct) REG model as we’ve seen before:\n\n\nmean_outcome_model <- function(data) {\n  glm(outcome ~ var_1 + var_2 + treatment, data = data)\n}\n\n\n\n\noutcome_model_estimator <- function(data) {\n   mean_model <- mean_outcome_model(data)\n   summary(mean_model)$coefficients['treatment', ][1]\n}\n\n\nREG Performance\n\n\n\nWhen outcome model is correctly modelled, this shows unbiased estimation of ACE.\nREG could also fail\nIf the model for Y is incorrect (as we recalled we left var_2 out), it will cause bias in the REG outcome model, which cause the model to fail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also overestimated the true ACE (10) if our REG model is mis-specified.\nCombining Strategy 1 and 2\nIf the propensity score model is incorrect, strategy 1 will not work\nIf the outcome model is incorrect, strategy 2 will not work\nIf you combine both approaches, you just need either one to work but not both\nThis is “doubly robust” property!\nDoubly Robust Estimator\nDRE’s estimation of average causal effect can be summarized into this equation (it is the same thing as the one in the previous section but we changed some notations):\n\\[\\hat{\\delta}_{DRE} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\bigg[\\frac{Y_{i}A_{i} -\\color{red}{(A_i-\\pi(Z_{i}))\\mu(Z_i, A_i)}}{\\pi(Z_{i})} - \\frac{Y_{i}(1-A_{i}) -\\color{red}{(A_i-\\pi(Z_{i}))\\mu(Z_i, A_i)}}{1-\\pi(Z_{i})}\\bigg]\\]\nwhere \\(\\pi(Z_i)=\\widehat {PS_i}\\) (propensity score from IPW), and \\(\\mu(Z_i, A_i)=E[Y|A=1,Z]\\) (this is the part of outcome regression model in DRE model). The term in red is said to augment the IPW estimator.\nWhen IPW and REG both correct\n\n\n\nThis is fine - we have a very unbiased estimation.\nLet’s analyze DRE’s performance under following settings:\nWhen IPW is Incorrect, REG is correct\nLet’s explore what happens to DRE when something goes wrong!\n\n\nprop_score_model <- function(data) {\n  # OOPS! I forgot var_2\n  glm(treatment ~ var_1, data = data, family = 'binomial')\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mean of estimates are above 10, indicating an overestimate of ACE. But this is still acceptable considering IPW is wrongly assigned - this is not too bad.\nWhen REG is incorrect, IPW is correct\n\n\nmean_outcome_model_w <- function(data) {\n  # HOW COULD I FORGOTTEN var_2??!?! I AM SO DUMB!\n  glm(outcome ~ var_1 + treatment, data = data)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough it performed worse than the first scenario in DRE (when both REG and IPW are correctly specified), the mean of this estimation is still fair and we can say it maintains robustness.\nWhen both REG and IPW are incorrect - DRE fails!!\nLet’s look at what happens to DRE estimation when both models are incorrectly identified. From previous slides, we learned how robust DRE is - its unbiasedness holds even if one of the models is incorrect, but this is not the case here!\n\n\nprop_score_model_w<- function(data) {\n  # OOPS! I forgot var_2\n  glm(treatment ~ var_1, data = data, family = 'binomial')\n}\nmean_outcome_model_w <- function(data) {\n  # HOW COULD I FORGOTTEN var_2??!?! I AM SO DUMB!\n  glm(outcome ~ var_1 + treatment, data = data)\n}\n\n\n\n\ndr_estimator_w <- function(data, prop_model_w, mean_model_w) {\n  data %>% \n    mutate(\n      prob = predict(prop_model_w, newdata = data, type = 'response'),\n      pred = predict(mean_model_w, newdata = data, type = 'response'),\n      augm = (treatment - prob)*pred\n    ) %>% \n    summarise(\n      EY0_dr = mean((outcome*(1 - treatment) - augm) / (1 - prob)),\n      EY1_dr = mean((outcome*treatment - augm) / prob)\n    ) %>% \n    mutate(dre_w = EY1_dr - EY0_dr)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis boxplot shows the summary of three DRE estimation in the three scenario we simulated. When both are incorrect, the mean of this estimation is far away from 10 (the true ACE, indicated by the red line).\nConclusion\nThis simulation activity shows how effective DRE is - that its effectiveness depends on correct model specification or outcome regression model (REG), or inverse Probability weighting by propensity score (IPW). Its robustness is maintained when one of the models is incorrect.\nFrom previous work, we have also identified and learned why DRE is unbiased when either of them is incorrect. If we have non-randomized trial experiments, we can surely apply methods introduced here today!\nReferences\nLunceford, Jared K., and Marie Davidian. “Stratification and weighting via the propensity score in estimation of causal treatment effects: a comparative study.” Statistics in medicine 23.19 (2004): 2937-2960.\nYouTube.
